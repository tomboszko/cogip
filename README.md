# COGIP Project - Backend Focus

## About The Project

Developed as part of the BeCode bootcamp, the COGIP project is a web application designed to modernize the accounting process for Jean-Christian Ranu at COGIP. This application primarily focuses on backend functionalities to enhance efficiency and user experience in accounting tasks.

## Backend Technologies

**PHP**: Used for server-side logic.

**POO** (Object-Oriented Programming): Enhances code modularity and reusability.

**MVC** (Model-View-Controller): Organizes code structure for efficient development and maintenance.

**Namespace**: Manages and encapsulates classes.

**Bramus Router**: A lightweight PHP router for handling HTTP requests.

**Filp/Whoops**: For elegant error handling in PHP.

## Team  Contributions

### backend

[Bastien](https://github.com/bastien-venturi): Focused on setting up the MVC architecture and integrating the Bramus Router for efficient request handling.

Thomas (me): Worked on database interactions, including CRUD operations, and implemented filp/whoops for error management.

We have implemented many others features, but there was the main work for each of us.
